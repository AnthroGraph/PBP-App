# PBP-App

A platform for recording and handling osteological data collected by the Phaleron Bioarchaeological Project.

## Technical Details

The software is an application for the [metaphactory framework](https://www.metaphacts.com/product). It is based on the [RDFBones App](https://github.com/AnthroGraph/RDFBones-App) which needs to be installed on the same system.

To ensure full functionality, the following ontologies need to be loaded to the system (in addition to the ones required by the RDFBones App):

* [Phaleron App Ontology](https://github.com/AnthroGraph/Phaleron-AppOntology) (phaleron-app)
* [Standards Skeletal Inventories](https://github.com/RDFBones/Standards-SkeletalInventories) (standards-si)
* [Phaleron Skeletal Inventories](https://github.com/RDFBones/Phaleron-SkeletalInventory) (phaleron-si)
* [Standards Pathologies](https://github.com/RDFBones/Standards-Pathologies) (standards-patho)
* [Phaleron Pathologies](https://github.com/RDFBones/Phaleron-Pathologies) (phaleron-patho)
